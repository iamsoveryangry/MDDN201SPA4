	<h2>A Short Guide to Understand This Meme Slightly Better</h2>
	<p>In the summer of 2016, this meme now known as "It's Free Real Estate" started to spread out all over the English-speaking Internet world.<sup><a href = "https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/its-free-real-estate" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup> It's funny even without having to understand what is behind this short video or even just the screen shot image of it. That's just the way we embrace memes! But have you ever wondered why? <a href = "https://www.thoughtco.com/science-of-memes-4147457" target="_blank">Here</a> is a good article to answer the question.
	</p>
	<p>This particular meme has a very specific reason why I engage with it strongly, apart from the fact that the two comedians have extremely funny expressions. Not only to me but I'm sure also to all those people who had spent much time watching TV infomercials.
	<br>Tim&Eric<sup><a href = "https://www.timanderic.com/" target = "_blank">[2]</a></sup>, the comedy duo and also the creators of the original TV show<sup><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_and_Eric_Awesome_Show,_Great_Job!" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup> which this meme came from, relies heavily on 1990's aesthetic. From fluorescent color elements on their official website to choices of materials in their show aired, they have been bringing back diverse elements from that era.
	<br>In the "Free Real Estate" original footage below shows they certainly re-generate the 90's aesthetic by editing of the video, choice of the fonts used, outfits and even the quality of the CGI, which looks a lot like one of many of those infomercials back in time.</p>

	<p><i>..It seems to be a cultural meme that nostalgia boosts creativity (both original and useful ideas; Feist, 1998), or at least literary creativity. Indeed, nostalgia has been duly implicated in explanations of creative works (Austin, 2003; Cook, 2009; Flinn, 1992). The link between nostalgia and creativity is plausible, given that nostalgia sparks approach orientation, evokes inspiration, and strengthens motivation to pursue oneâ€™s important goal(s).<sup><a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Constantine_Sedikides/publication/324939247_Nostalgia_Shapes_and_Potentiates_the_Future/links/5afc1d0da6fdccacab199a8c/Nostalgia-Shapes-and-Potentiates-the-Future.pdf" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup></i></p>
	<p>The nostalgia we experience through this meme and similar pop culture trend will only be regenerated as the time goes by, because we usually retain a sense of emotional connection to the media of their childhood and, in turn, will create art that is either consciously or unconsciously informed by what resonated with us when we were growing up.<sup><a href = "https://filmschoolrejects.com/pop-culture-obsessed-with-1980s/" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup></p>
